Introduction
============

`FarmSubsidy <http://farmsubsidy.openspending.org/>`_ is a website that collects the payment data of
the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) which represents about a third of the EU budget. It was run by 
a group of journalists and activists for the past years. In 2013 the `OpenSpending project <http://openspending.org/>`_
of the `Open Knowledge Foundation <http://okfn.org/>`_ took over responsibility of the website.


Background Information
======================

If you need an introduction to the topic, you can have a look at the 
`Wikipedia article <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy>`_ about EU agricultural policiy 
or at the `CAP website from the European Commision <http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-funding/index_en.htm>`_. 
The wikipedia article is quite long, for an introduction to the structure of the subsidies just read the 
`The CAP today <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy#The_CAP_today>`_ section.

The main thing you have to know, is that European agricultural subsidies are divided into two funds. 
*The European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF)* 
(`Wikipedia > EAGF <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Agricultural_Guarantee_Fund>`_) 
is for direct payments for farmers (majority of payments) and for measures to respond to market disturbances. 
You will find these two posts separately distinguished in the data provided.

The second fund is the *European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD)* 
(`Wikipedia > EAFRD <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Agricultural_Fund_for_Rural_Development>`_).
